I made the following Assumptions, while creating the Solution
 

1) WPC provides 3 separate API calls for that provide Usage Data for
   Calls,Data, and TextMessages.
   So that Customer Can select and Choose Each of the Sections Usage/Billing.
   
   In House Tax Calculator(WPCTaxCalculator.java) is used for Tax Calculation.
   
   
2) I am using Spring Framework for the Web Application.
   Transaction Control is provided as part of the Framework, which I used.
   Cache Service is provided by EHCache Framework, which I used. 
      
3) Merchat Bank provides A SOA Web Service and WSDL, which will be integrated 
   with the WPC Application.

4) Used Decorator Design Pattern for the Calculation of  Data for
   Calls,Data, and TextMessages Usage.

5) Used Front Controller, Intercepting Filter for 
	- User Authentication. - WPCLoginController
	- For Credit Card Validation. - WPCCreditCardCaontroller, it validates the Input 
      and checks the Credit Card Expiry Date, and Valid Number of Digits based on each type
      of card, Before making the Request to Merchant Bank/Payment Gateway.
