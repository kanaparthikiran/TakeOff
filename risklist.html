This File Contains Risk List.

Risk#1

The Merchant Bank Web Service could go down, or could be under load, and may not 
respond within the TimeOut then TimeOut Exception may occur.

Mitigation Plan#
I will let the Web Service Client to check the Web Service Status for a retry count of 3 times, 
if they fall under 3 seconds SLA, this way We can reduce the timeout use cases.

In case the Merchant Bank's Web Service does not respond even after 3 seconds, Will show an Information
message to the Customer saying 
"Contact Customer Service Phone Number" or "Retry the Payment at a later time, as there is an error in Payment Processing"


Risk#2

Security is of Paramount importance to the WPC Application, As the Credit Card Processing is done at WPC.
There could be a chance of PCI Compliance issues, So I will make sure that all PCI compliance issues are 
prevented before hand. Also will take care of the all Open Web Application Security Project Vulnerabilities
like 

SQL Injection - By Validating, and Sanitizing the User Input, and Response Output. So that they do not contain
any invalid characters, that lets an attacker take control of the Web Site.

Encryption - The Transportation is Secured between Client, and Server using SSL/HTTPS, so that any attacker like
Eavesdropper,ManIntheMiddle attacks are mitigated.


Risk#3

WPC Web Site could get too much Load and the System may not be able to address the SLA.
We mitigate this chance by adding Load Balancer at the Web Server.
Creating Load Balancers at Application Server Layer, and Creating Clustering of the Application Servers.


WPC Web Site Could be a target Denial of Service(DOS) attacks.
I prevent this by using Switches for Traffic, and White listing of the IP Addresses.


Risk#4
 
Non Functional Requirements List
-
SLA of 3 seconds.
Scalability of Thousand % for the first year.
Availability of 99.99% during Core Working hours.
Security (128- bit encryption)
